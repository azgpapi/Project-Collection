## Overview




## My process
		I HAD REALLY AMAZING EXPERIENCE, it was my first time making projects
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (fully can be said)



### What I learned
What i learned is really like to never give up on our projects, it is my first time though it is a bit difficult but enjoyed it so much.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
I am proud of Span property.
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
 always and will be proud of flexbox and its power.
}

### Continued development

I want to focus as a beginner, i am aware of the selectors really need to know how they work and studying about flexbox and so many css advanced topics.

### Useful resources

CHATGPT really helped me.
